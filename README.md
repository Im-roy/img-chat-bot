# img-chat-bot

*Project Overview:*

This project focuses on the development of a chat-bot equipped with various functionalities to enhance user interaction and assistance.

*Key Features:*

1. Textual Query Handling: Users can interact with the chat-bot by typing questions in text format. The chat-bot processes these queries and provides relevant responses.

2. Image Recognition and Query: The chat-bot supports image upload functionality, allowing users to submit images alongside their questions. Utilizing image recognition capabilities, the chat-bot can interpret these images and provide responses based on the content.

3. Image Retrieval: In addition to accepting image uploads, users can also request specific images from the chat-bot. The chat-bot retrieves and delivers the requested images as part of its responses.

*Technology Stack:*

1. Backend Development: The chat-bot's backend is developed using Golang, a programming language known for its efficiency and concurrency support, making it well-suited for handling real-time interactions.

2. Database Management: Postgres is utilized for data storage and retrieval within the chat-bot system. Its robust relational database capabilities ensure efficient management of user data and interactions.

3. AI Integration: Gemini AI, an open-source AI framework, is seamlessly integrated into the chat-bot project. This AI framework enhances the chat-bot's capabilities, enabling it to process natural language queries, analyze images, and generate appropriate responses.

With these features and technologies in place, the chat-bot project aims to provide users with an intuitive and efficient platform for seeking information and assistance through textual and visual interactions.
